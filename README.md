## Hypoxia_Classifier

<h1><b>Introduction</b></h1>
<p>Hypoxia, a state of reduced oxygen in the tumour environment, is known to promote cancer progression and resistance to treatment. Thus, it is imperative to be able to identify hypoxic cells and their genetic markers, to implement targeted treatments. The goal of this project is to identify patterns and biomarkers linked to hypoxic cells and build a classifier that can identify whether a cell is hypoxic or normal.</p>

<p>Our first goal will be to pre-process the datasets, making sure that we have a high-quality, consistent data set that can be used to train a model. Next, we will conduct exploratory data analysis, to give us a better understanding of the data we are working with. After this, we will use unsupervised learning techniques (PCA and clustering) to uncover patterns and correlations between the hypoxic cells and the normal cells. Finally, we will train models on the data to build a robust classifier able to differentiate between normal and hypoxic cells.</p>

**N.B.** 
*As the data used for this project is classified, we have used placeholders where specific genetic markers were mentioned (e.g. Feature 1, Feature 2, etc.).*
